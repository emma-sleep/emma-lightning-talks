# Emma Lightning Talks Contribution Guide

Everyone at Emma is invited to share their knowledge in one or more of our weekly lightning talks.
If you have a topic that you want to present, just enter it in [Confluence](https://emma-sleep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/2843901953/Lightning+Talks) and sync with the organizer to find a suitable date for your talk.

## Adding Assets to this Repository

To add assets for your lightning talk to this repository, just add a folder with your assets to this repository.
The folder should follow the following naming scheme `YYYY-MM-DD_name_of_your_lightning_talk` where `YYYY-MM-DD` refers to the date of your lightning talk. Example: `2022-04-12_docker_compose_basics`.

Following this naming scheme ensures that the lightning talk assets appear in order of their presentation date.

After you created your assets, create a pull request and once the pull request is merged, make sure to link the assets as a resource on [Confluence](https://emma-sleep.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/2843901953/Lightning+Talks).
